# Requirements — <feature-id>

Strict **EARS**. Each requirement has a stable id (`R1`, `R2`, …). Tasks in
`tasks.md` reference these ids. Do not invent business rules — leave undefined
points as open questions and mark the feature `blocked`.

## EARS forms

- `The system SHALL <requirement>.`
- `WHEN <trigger> THEN the system SHALL <requirement>.`
- `WHILE <state> the system SHALL <requirement>.`
- `WHERE <feature is present> the system SHALL <requirement>.`
- `IF <condition> THEN the system SHALL <requirement>.`

## Requirements

- **R1** — The system SHALL <…>.
- **R2** — WHEN <trigger> THEN the system SHALL <…>.

## Open questions

- <undefined point — blocks the feature until the human answers> (or "none").
